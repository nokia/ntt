// NOTE: the test shall pass as empty set (in this case a list of allowed out types) is always a subset
// of another set (in this case a list of allowed in types). For that reason, the test was changed
// into a positive one as it does not violate any TTCN-3 requirement.
// Of course it doesn't make much sense to connect these two ports as communication is not possible
// between them. A CR7607 was submitted to mantis to add a new restriction to the core language standard.
