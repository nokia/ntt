The @configuration port:XYZ directive in the header indicates the type of adapter being used. 
The two possible port: values are broadcast/loopback.
For historical reasons, the absence of this directive means loopback adapter.
Example:
 ** @configuration  port:broadcast

The following example indicates external functions used in the test case  
 ** @configuration  external_functions
