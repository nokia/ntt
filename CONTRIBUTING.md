# Contributing to NTT

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

We welcome contributions to NTT of any kind including documentation, plugins,
organization, tutorials, bug reports, issues, feature requests, feature
implementations, pull requests, answering questions on the mailing list, helping
to manage issues, etc.


## Asking Support Questions

We use mailing list [ntt@groups.io](mailto:ntt@groups.io) where users and
developers can ask questions. Please don't use the GitHub issue tracker to ask
questions.


## Reporting Issues

If you believe you have found an issue in k3, please use the GitHub issue tracker
to report the Problem. If you're not sure if it's a bug or not, start by asking
on the mailing list [ntt@groups.io](mailto:ntt@groups.io).


## Pull Requests

0. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository
0. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
0. Make your change and remember to add tests
0. Build the project locally and run local tests
0. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]
0. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull
request being accepted:

* Write tests.
* Format your code.
* Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you
  would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, submit them as
  separate pull requests.
* Write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
