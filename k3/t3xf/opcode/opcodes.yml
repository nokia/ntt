    Push an object name literal onto the stack, coded as an ASCII
    string. This is a variable-length instruction with the details
    of the name following the instruction itself: first, a length
    field, and then the bytes of the string.
    
    The length field is encoded with the same byte order as has
    been selected for instructions. The string itself is always
    encoded with the first byte of the string at the lowest file
    offset – the natural ordering for strings.
    
    Padding shall be placed at the end of the string bytes to
    restore the correct alignment for following instructions.

    Push a signed integer literal onto the stack. This is a

    integer following the instruction itself as a native long.
    
    The literal integer value is encoded at the same width and
    byte ordering as is currently selected for instructions: is
    must be swapped when swapping is enabled.
    
    If the currently selected instruction width is too small for
